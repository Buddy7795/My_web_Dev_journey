<!-- A function is a piece of code that can take an input and perform a specific action.   -->

<!-- Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors.
    If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray.
    But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter 
    It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page  -->

<!-- 
    The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.
    H:Heu(0-360)
    S:Saturation(0-100 in %)
    L:Lightness(0 -100 in %)
The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values:
    A number from 0 to 360 for hue
    A percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation
    A percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel,
    The hue red is at 0 degrees
    The hue green is at 120 degrees
    The hue blue is at 240 degrees.
Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color. 
You must add the percent sign "%" to the saturation and lightness values.
Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral. -->

<!-- A gradient is when one color transitions into another. 
The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.
One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.

linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...); 
gradientDirection is the direction of the line used for the transition.
color1 and color2 are color arguments, which are the colors that will be used in the transition itself. 
These can be any type of color, including color keywords, hex, rgb, or hsl. 

Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. 
They are a length unit like px or percentages that follow a color in the linear-gradient function.
For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line so red takes up most of the available space:
Example Code: linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black);  -->

<!-- Opacity describes how opaque, or non-transparent, something is.
For example, a solid wall is opaque, and no light can pass through. 
But a drinking glass is much more transparent, and you can see through the glass to the other side.
With the CSS opacity property, you can control how opaque or transparent an element is.
   With the value 0 or 0%, the element will be completely transparent
   And at 1.0 or 100%, the element will be completely opaque like it is by default. -->

<!-- Another way to set the opacity for an element is with the alpha channel.
Similar to the opacity property, the alpha channel controls how transparent or opaque a color is. 

The rgba function works just like the rgb function, but takes one more number from 0 to 1.0 for the alpha channel.
Example Code: rgba(redValue, greenValue, blueValue, alphaValue);  -->

<!-- The margin shorthand property makes it easy to set multiple margin areas at the same time. 
The shorthand margin property has two values..
   margin-top and margin-bottom to the first value
   margin-left and margin-right to the second value

   margin: auto
This sets margin-top,margin-right,margin-bottom, and margin-left all to auto 
    margin-top: 0px;
    margin-bottom: 0px;
    margin-left: 0px;
    margin-right: 0px; -->

<!-- The border shorthand property lets you to set the border's width, style, and color at the same time. 
              border: width style color;
Example Code: border: 2opx solid black;   -->


<!-- The box-shadow property lets you apply one or more shadows around an element. 
box-shadow: offsetX offsetY color; 
box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius color; 
box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius spreadRadius color; 
Here's how the offsetX and ffsetY values work:
⦁	both offsetX and offsetY accept number values in px and other CSS units
⦁	a positive offsetX value moves the shadow right and a negative value moves it left
⦁	a positive offsetY value moves the shadow down and a negative value moves it up
⦁	if you want a value of zero (0) for any or both offsetX and offsetY, you don't need to add a unit. Every browser understands that zero means no change.
The height and width of the shadow is determined by the height and width of the element it's applied to. 
You can also use an optional spreadRadius value to spread out the reach of the shadow -->

<!-- 
The vh unit stands for viewport height, and is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport.
This makes it relative to the viewport height.

The rem unit stands for root em
It's relative to the font size of the html element. 

The select element is a container for a group of option elements
The option element acts as a label for each dropdown option.
Both elements require closing tags. 
The textarea element acts like an input element of type text,
    but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows and columns 
You can select the last element of a specific type using the last-of-type CSS pseudo-class, like this: p:last-of-type { }  -->
